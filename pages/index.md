## Research

I care about **Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) security**.  Today FPGAs are
used in everything from datacenters to airplanes, so ensuring secure FPGA
operations is rapidly becoming as critical as processor-based systems.  My
students and I help design new security layers for existing FPGAs and designs
for new FPGA architectures focused on improved security.

Our group is currently focused on three main projects: 

 * FPGA bitstream tamper prevention 
 * FPGA piracy detection
 * Security of non-volatile FPGA architectures

For more details, please check out our research group, [SAIL-IN](http://fpga.luddy.indiana.edu).

## Teaching

I am currently teaching [ENGR-315 "Hardware/Software
Codesign"](https://engr315.github.io).
